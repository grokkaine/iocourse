    "    - PCA is good at isolating feature that contain sufficient signal, but will transform the dataset in the direction of maximal variability\n",
    "    - NMF will not have you lose the original features, you can see it as a data compression tool and has superior interpretability\n",
    "    - Autoencoders are good for high dimensional complex datasets, but it is difficult to interpret your findings beside a simple clustering\n",
    "- Factors interpretability: \n",
    "    - PCA: search for optimal rank k approximations, using it as a linear basis fit to re-write the data.\n",
    "    - NMF: your data is written as a weighted sum of the basis you learn, but multiple basis can be just as good.\n",
    "    - Autoencoder: fators are difficult to interpret, but can capture nonlinear effects.\n",
    "- What it tries to explain:\n",
    "    - PCA: variation in the data (it is an SvD on the covariation matrix, performing sequential normalizations of data along axes of variation)\n",
    "    - NMF: additive signal, the very purpose of NMF is to isolate distinct and interpretable signals (paterns) within the data\n",
    "    - Autoencoder: an autoencoder simply tries to reproduce it's original signal.\n",
    "- Dimensionality curse:\n",
    "    - PCA: better at smaller datasets, covariation tends to be equal at large dimensions, good at isolating signal from noise from data\n",
    "    - NMF: even better at small datasets, provided a good signal fit is found, good at isolating paterns\n",
